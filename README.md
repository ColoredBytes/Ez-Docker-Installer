# Easy Docker Installer

### **Why you ask?**

Glad you Asked! I use docker for alot of my Homelab and currently run it on Rocky Linux. Which works great BTW! The issue I had was that Dockers install script located [Here](https://get.docker.com/) currently does not have support for RHEL like systesms minus [Fedora](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/fedora/) and [RHEL](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/rhel/) for s390x architecture. So I made this to make it easier on myself and perhaps others so we don't need to manually install all the time. 


### **Insttructions**
